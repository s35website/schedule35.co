			<h3 class="t0">It’s Not Magic, it’s Science.</h3>
			
			<p>
				Despite our product being dubbed as ‘magic’ mushrooms, they’re science-backed and thoroughly researched, tested, and verified. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As professionals and creatives, we were looking for solutions to help us focus and get our creative juices flowing. We stumbled onto the psychedelic space and quickly learned about the benefits of microdosing psilocybin cubensis. Through countless research and testing, we created S35, a microdosing regimen designed to help you think clearly and get shit done.

			<h3 class="t42">The Elephant in the Room</h3>
			
			<p>
				Don’t worry. It’s a figurative elephant - you’re not tripping out. For a lot of new users, we understand your hesitation to try microdosing. And why wouldn’t you? There’s still a social stigma and general misinformation around psychedelics that’s been fueled by misconceptions and irrational fears. We’re sure you have a lot of questions and we’re here to educate.
