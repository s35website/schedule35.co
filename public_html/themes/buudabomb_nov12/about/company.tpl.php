			<p>Everyone loves getting high, but as young, active professionals we also wanted something healthy that allowed us to enjoy the countless benefits of cannabis, without inhaling the potentially harmful toxins associated with it.</p>

			<p>After spending many hazy nights at 420 events, we noticed there was a massive gap in the edibles market. Dosed with huge amounts of THC, a single gummy bear had the power to take out an entire army.
			</p>
			
			<p>It became clear these products were focused on creating edibles as potent as possible but werenâ€™t focused on important factors like taste, packaging and, most importantly, the overall experience of cannabis.</p>

			<p>Getting high out of our minds is fun, but we needed to be able to function and do the things we loved. That's when our semi-pothead brains lit up. </p>

			<p><em>"Dude, we should just make our own."</em></p>

			<p>After many days and nights researching and testing gummy recipes, we stumbled upon a formula we truly fell in love with.</p>
			
			<p><strong>These handmade edibles were tasty, organic and infused with just the right amount of THC. </strong></p>
			
			<p>As word spread about <?php echo $core->company; ?>s, people began asking if they could buy our tasty little treats. That's when we officially set up shop and began our adventure in making, what we believe, are the best edibles on the market.
